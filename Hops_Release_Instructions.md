#Build and Release instructions

First download and build the play framework in parent directory of this project. That is, "ls ../activator-1.3.10-minimal" should work.


Then run:
./deploy.sh

to upload the built binaries to snurran.sics.se. This completes a new release of dr-elephant for Hopsworks.
